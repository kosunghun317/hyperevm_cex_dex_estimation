# HyperEVM CEX-DEX Arbitrage Estimation
This repo is largely unstructured and contains useless failed scripts and messy data due to the laziness of author.
For tldr check ```mev_analysis/``` directory for resulting data and statistics, and check ```get_swap_events_via_block_receipt.py``` and ```mev_stats.py``` for code to get swap events.
